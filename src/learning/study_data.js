In a person with Asthma, these 'branches' are hyper-sensitive. When they get irritated by a trigger—like dust, cold air, or stress—three bad things happen at once: 1) The muscles wrapped around the tubes squeeze tight (Bronchospasm), 2) The inside walls of the tubes swell up like a bruised thumb (Inflammation), and 3) The body produces thick 'glue-like' mucus that plugs the holes. This makes the airway so narrow that it’s like trying to breathe through a tiny, pinched coffee stirrer. The 'wheezing' sound you hear is actually the sound of air whistling as it tries to force its way through those tiny openings.", 
        treat: "1. Sit the person upright (High-Fowler's position) to give the lungs room to expand. 2. Keep them calm, as anxiety makes the muscles squeeze tighter. 3. Provide high-concentration oxygen via a mask. 4. Help them use their 'Rescue Inhaler' (usually a blue Albuterol inhaler); this medicine acts like a 'muscle relaxer' for the lungs to open the tubes back up. 5. If they are struggling to speak in full sentences, call for advanced life support (Paramedics) immediately."

Histamine is the opposite of Adrenaline; it causes massive Vasodilation (pipes get wide and leaky) and Bronchoconstriction (airways squeeze shut). This is NOT 'Fight or Flight'—it is actually the body's 'Panic Mode.' Because the blood pipes get so wide, the blood just sits in the legs and can't get to the brain, causing the patient to pass out. To fix this, we have to manually trigger a 'Fight or Flight' response by injecting Epinephrine (Adrenaline). The Adrenaline fights the Histamine by forcing the pipes to shrink (Vasoconstriction) and the lungs to open back up.",

        info: "The burn has reached the second layer of skin (dermis). This is the most painful type of burn because the nerve endings are exposed and irritated. The hallmark sign is BLISTERS and 'weeping' (wet-looking) skin.",
        treat: "1. Stop the burning process with water or saline. 2. Do NOT pop blisters (they protect against infection). 3. Cover loosely with a dry, sterile dressing. 4. Elevate burned extremities to reduce swelling."

        info: "The skin is destroyed all the way down to the fat, muscle, or bone. The area may look charred (black) or leathery and white. Surprisingly, the center of the burn may be PAINLESS because the nerves have been completely destroyed, though the edges (2nd degree) will hurt intensely.",
        treat: "1. Dry, sterile dressings only (no water/creams on large 3rd-degree burns). 2. Keep the patient warm (they lose heat fast without skin). 3. Watch for airway swelling if the burn was caused by fire/smoke."

        name: "Inhalation Burns",
        info: "The patient breathed in super-heated air or smoke. This causes the airway to swell shut, which can kill the patient faster than the skin burns. Look for soot (black dust) around the nose/mouth, singed nasal hairs, or a raspy, 'hoarse' voice.",
        treat: "1. High-flow Oxygen is mandatory. 2. Request ALS (Paramedics) early for advanced airway management. 3. Rapid transport—the airway could slam shut in minutes."

        info: "Caused by strong acids or bases (like drain cleaner). The chemical will keep burning the patient as long as it is on the skin. You must remove the 'fuel' to stop the fire.",
        treat: "1. Brush off dry powders first (don't add water yet!). 2. Flush with massive amounts of water for at least 20 minutes. 3. Remove all contaminated clothing and jewelry. 4. Do not try to 'neutralize' with other chemicals."

        info: "The body acts as a wire for electricity. The damage is often hidden inside (internal organs). You will see an 'Entrance' wound and an 'Exit' wound. The biggest danger is the electricity 'resetting' the heart into a deadly rhythm.",
        treat: "1. Ensure the power is OFF before touching the patient. 2. Look for exit wounds (often on the feet). 3. Treat like a Cardiac patient—monitor the pulse closely. 4. Cover visible burns with dry dressings."

        name: "Pneumothorax (Collapsed Lung)",
        info: "Think of the lung like a balloon inside a box. If a rib pokes the balloon, air leaks into the 'box' (chest cavity). Now, every time the person breathes, the air fills the space around the lung instead of inside it, causing the lung to shrivel up. If the pressure gets too high, it becomes a 'Tension Pneumothorax,' which squishes the heart and is fatal.",
        treat: "1. High-flow Oxygen. 2. Listen for 'Absent' lung sounds on one side. 3. Position of comfort. 4. Rapid transport—this requires a hospital chest tube to re-inflate the lung."

        info: "This is a hole in the chest wall. When the patient breathes, air is sucked through the hole instead of the windpipe. This air will quickly collapse the lung. You will hear a 'hissing' or 'sucking' sound with every breath.",
        treat: "1. Immediately cover the hole with a gloved hand. 2. Apply an 'Occlusive Dressing' (plastic/Vaseline gauze). 3. Tape it on THREE sides only—this acts as a one-way valve to let air out but not back in."

        treat: "1. Oxygen is the priority. 2. Provide 'Bulky Dressing' support by hand to stabilize the area. 3. CPAP can help 'push' the flail segment out from the inside using air pressure."
